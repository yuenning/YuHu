Our target audience mainly comprises small business owners who are looking for an innovative and affordable inventory management solution that caters specifically to their unique needs, allowing them to thrive and succeed in their competitive market.

1.2 Motivation
In the current market, many existing inventory management applications are expensive and cater primarily to larger enterprises, leaving small businesses at a disadvantage. These applications often come with complex user interfaces that require extensive training and technical expertise to navigate effectively. This lack of affordability and user-friendliness hinders small businesses from accessing the tools they need to optimise their inventory management processes.
At YuHu, we are motivated to address these gaps in the market by offering a cost-efficient and user-friendly inventory management web application specifically designed for small businesses. Our solution is tailored to meet the unique needs and budgets of small businesses, providing them with an accessible and affordable alternative. By focusing on simplicity and intuitiveness, we aim to create a user-friendly interface that requires minimal training, ensuring that small business owners and their employees can quickly adapt to and utilise our platform effectively.
